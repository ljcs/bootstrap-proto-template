Bootstrap protoyping template 


## what you need

  You need a couple of things before you can get on your way:
    - A Mac
    - A static site generator in this case Cactus for Mac http://cactusformac.com/
    - A basic understanding of the syntax that Cactus uses http://cactusformac.com/docs/
  
## Getting started
  
  Run cactus and add the local repository, you can preview the website or start editing it right away
  
## setup of the files
  There are a couple of folders
    .build (this is where cactus serves the site from)
    Pages (this is where you place your.... html pages)
    Plugins (contains files for extra plugins for cactus)
    Static (for all you CSS, JS, images and fonts)
    Templates (here we create base files and components)
